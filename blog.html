            <div class="collapse-content">
              <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects. It allows JavaScript to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and styles of web pages by interacting with the elements, attributes, and events.</p>

            <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">What is the relationship between HTML and the DOM?</div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
              <p>The HTML document is the structure or skeleton of a webpage, while the DOM is a representation of that document that browsers create to allow dynamic interaction with the webpage. The DOM reflects the structure of the HTML, and JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to change the content, structure, and style of the page in real-time, even after it has loaded.</p>

            <div class="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">How does the DOM tree structure work?</div>
            <div class="collapse-content">
              <p>The DOM is structured as a tree, where the root is the document object, and every element, text, attribute, and comment is a node within this tree. Parent nodes can have child nodes, forming a hierarchical relationship. The root element (typically <html>) is the parent, and all other elements like head-tag, body-tag and their respective children form branches of the tree.</p>

                <div class="collapse-content">
                  <p>Manipulating the DOM is considered expensive because every time the DOM is updated, the browser has to recalculate styles, layout, and repaint the affected parts of the page. These processes consume significant computational resources. Frequent or inefficient DOM manipulations (like adding or changing elements repeatedly) can lead to slow performance, reflows, and jankiness, especially in large or complex web pages. To mitigate this, developers often batch updates or use techniques like document fragments.</p>
